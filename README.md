# AMBE3000 Arduino Module in KiCad 8
A PCB containing a DVSI AMBE-3000R (or AMBE-3003) Vocoders for use with WebSDRs/Audio transcoding.

This board is based on the design by George Smart, M1GEO and Chris Smart, G8OCV.

The DVSI AMBE parts can be purchased in low volume from the [DVSI Inc. Hardware Product Pricing](https://www.dvsinc.com/products/price.shtml) page. You will need to create a purchase order to buy from DVSI.

# Assembly

The design schematic include details for [JLCPCB](https://jlcpcb.com/) assembly, who assembled mine. You'll likely have to reflow the DVSI AMBE-3000R part yourself, which I did with a PCB reflow hotplate, but you can do any way you wish.

Each schematic component has a [JLCPCB Parts](https://jlcpcb.com/parts)/[LCSC](https://www.lcsc.com/) part number (Cxxxxxx), which can be exported to the BoM using the extra field "LCSC".
